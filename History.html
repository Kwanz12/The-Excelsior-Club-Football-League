            <h3>What is The Excelsior Club Football League?</h3>
        </element>
        <p>Liga XCLR Football League stands for Excelsior Club Football League. This league was mainly created to cater towards students on dorm. Dorm League was also created to help foster brotherhood, healthy competition and unity amongst peers who lived on Cedar Hall. This is where the Excelsior Club orginates. To dive into a bit of history... </p>

            <h4>What's going on now?</h4>
            <p>In most recent years, during the 2024-2025 season, rangers have won the fall semester season, making them just one title behind archers, with the most titles in history.</p>
            <p>The All time goal scorer record is still held by Ivanhoe Smith to this day, Wonder who will break it?</p>
            <p>The all time assist record is still held by antoine walker, and the clean sheet record, has not been broken as yet.</p>
            <p>Recently, we have seen a surge of talented players making their way foward to possibly breaking some records this season. During the 2024 Fall Semester Season, Jordan Brian Sterling, the Cardinals Captain for that season, scored 4 goals in a single season. Alongside Amos Brydon who scored 3 for his squad, the rangers team. Hats off to these Gentlmen. As we look to the future, youngsters such as Tajheim Henry and Jhavell Henry seem like the likliest prospects to perform in the 2025 Spring Semester Season.</p>
